# New Macbook environment setup

1. Install homebrew first (for some reason this doesn't work in the script)
2. Run `sh .init.sh` to setup initial system dependencies
3. Run `./setup.sh` to install and configure everything else
2. (Optional) run `./macos` to configure macbook global system settings 
3. Copy `tmuxinator` into the `~/.config/` folder 
4. Edit iterm preferences to load from the `iterm-profile.json` file for all settings
